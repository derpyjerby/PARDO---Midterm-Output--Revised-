# PARDO-Midterm-Output-Sequelize-

Hello! This is a revised version of my to-do list output (midterm) except this is integrated with the sequelize library.

But to use, first perform:

`npm install`

to include all possible dependecies then migrate the schemas into your localhost:

`npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`

All should work fine. Arigathanks! :D
